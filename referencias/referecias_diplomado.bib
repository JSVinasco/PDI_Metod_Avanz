  ABSTRACT        = {Boosted by the progress in deep learning, Single Image
                  Super-Resolution (SISR) has gained a lot of interest in the
                  remote sensing community, who sees it as an opportunity to
                  compensate for satellites’ ever-limited spatial resolution
                  with respect to end users’ needs. This is especially true for
                  Sentinel-2 because of its unique combination of resolution,
                  revisit time, global coverage and free and open data policy.
                  While there has been a great amount of work on network
                  architectures in recent years, deep-learning-based SISR in
                  remote sensing is still limited by the availability of the
                  large training sets it requires. The lack of publicly
                  available large datasets with the required variability in
                  terms of landscapes and seasons pushes researchers to simulate
                  their own datasets by means of downsampling. This may impair
                  the applicability of the trained model on real-world data at
                  the target input resolution. This paper presents SEN2VENµS, an
                  open-data licensed dataset composed of 10 m and 20 m
                  cloud-free surface reflectance patches from Sentinel-2, with
                  their reference spatially registered surface reflectance
                  patches at 5 m resolution acquired on the same day by the
                  VENµS satellite. This dataset covers 29 locations on earth
                  with a total of 132,955 patches of 256 × 256 pixels at 5 m
                  resolution and can be used for the training and comparison of
                  super-resolution algorithms to bring the spatial resolution of
                  8 of the Sentinel-2 bands up to 5 m.},
